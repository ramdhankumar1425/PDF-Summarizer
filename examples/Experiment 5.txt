This EE211 Digital Circuits Lab experiment involves designing a stopwatch with a four-digit display showing seconds and hundredths of a second (e.g., 23.78).  A single push-button cycles through three states: RESET (00.00 display), START (counts up by 1/100th second), and STOP (freezes the display).  The design utilizes a 16-bit fully synchronous BCD counter (cascaded 74160-74163 counters), a 10ms clock generator (using a 555 timer), and a debouncing circuit for the push button.  Students must implement the circuit, demonstrate its operation, and simulate the clock and debouncing circuits using LTSpice.  Pre-lab preparation includes studying datasheets for the 74160-74163 counters and the 555 timer, focusing on synchronous/asynchronous clears, counter cascading, and astable multivibrator configurations, as well as researching switch debouncing techniques.
