Digital-Verse is an interactive digital circuit simulator built with React, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.  It allows users to design combinational and (soon) sequential circuits using a drag-and-drop interface with a library of components (gates, adders, multiplexers, 7-segment displays).  Features include a truth table generator, Boolean expression simplification (using Quine-McCluskey), user account management for saving circuits, live simulation, export options (PNG), and numerous keyboard shortcuts.  The project is open-source and welcomes contributions.  Setup requires Node.js, MongoDB, and environment variable configuration.
