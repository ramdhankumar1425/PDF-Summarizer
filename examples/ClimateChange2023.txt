The IPCC's 2023 Synthesis Report (AR6) unequivocally confirms human-caused climate change, evidenced by rising global temperatures (1.1°C above pre-industrial levels), increasing greenhouse gas emissions, and widespread changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and biosphere.  These changes have already caused substantial and increasingly irreversible losses and damages to both nature and people, disproportionately affecting vulnerable communities.

While adaptation efforts have progressed, significant gaps remain, and maladaptation is occurring in some areas.  Current funding is insufficient.  Mitigation policies have expanded but are insufficient to limit warming to 1.5°C or even 2°C, highlighting a large emissions gap.  Projected 2030 emissions based on current Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) make exceeding 1.5°C warming likely.

Future climate change will intensify multiple hazards, with every increment of warming exacerbating risks.  Some changes are unavoidable, particularly sea-level rise, but their severity can be limited by deep emissions cuts.  Limiting warming requires net-zero CO2 emissions, which necessitates rapid and deep emissions reductions across all sectors this decade, including substantial non-CO2 reductions and the deployment of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies.  Overshooting 1.5°C will lead to additional risks and irreversible impacts.

The report emphasizes the urgent need for integrated climate action, combining mitigation and adaptation, to achieve climate-resilient development.  This necessitates systemic transitions across all sectors, leveraging available feasible and cost-effective options while acknowledging potential synergies and trade-offs with sustainable development goals.  Prioritizing equity, climate justice, and just transition processes is crucial for enabling effective climate action and ensuring equitable outcomes.  Increased international cooperation, financing, technological innovation, and effective governance are essential for achieving climate goals.
