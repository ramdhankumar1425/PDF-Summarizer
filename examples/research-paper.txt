This paper investigates the impact of generative AI tools (GAITs) on content diversity in competitive environments.  Existing research shows GAITs reduce diversity; this work analyzes the consequences.  A game-theoretic model, using Scattergories as a metaphor, demonstrates that while stronger competition mitigates homogeneity, equilibrium diversity remains below the social optimum.  Surprisingly, a GAIT's performance in isolation doesn't guarantee success in competition.  Empirical results using language models playing Scattergories validate these findings, highlighting the importance of "competitive alignment" in GAIT development and evaluation.  The study emphasizes the need for evaluating GAITs not just in isolation, but also in competitive contexts, considering the interplay between diversity and quality.
